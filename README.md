In this project we have tried to incorporate multiple games and given an interface to the user to select the particular game they want to play. We have used cpp for the project. We have incorporated concepts like vector, ctime, algorithm etc. It has been a humble effort from our side to create a mini project like this. It includes games like Hangman, Guess the number, Snake game, Pacman, tic-tac-toe, RockPaperScissor and quiz. Binding it all together is the interface which allows the user to choose what they want to play. 
The contribution by each person is as follows:

1. Shalvi: Pacman, Snake Game 
2. Nicole: Hangman
3. Anjana: Guess the number
4. Sohini: Quiz game, Rock Paper Scissor
5. Prachi: Tic Tac Toe
6. Suchetna: main interface, Rock Paper Scissor
