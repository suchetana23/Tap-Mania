In this project we have tried to incorporate multiple games and given an interface to the user to select the particular game they want to play. We have used cpp for the project. We have incorporated concepts like vector, ctime, algorithm etc. It has been a humble effort from our side to create a mini project like this. It includes games like Hangman, Guess the number, Snake game, Pacman, tic-tac-toe and quiz. Binding it all together is the interface which allows the user to choose what they want to play.
